- TIL Apache Hive
- it seems like Hive is built on top of Hadoop
- a distributed, fault-tolerant data warehouse system that enables analytics at a massive scale. A data warehouse provides a central store of information that can easily be analyzed to make informed, data driven decisions. 

8/25/25:
- "The instance must be in the stopped state to modify its placement properties. You cannot change the tenancy of an instance from default to dedicated or host after you've launched it."
- so yeah if a running instance doesnt let you modify its placement (`Modify instance placement` grayed out), then stop the instance first

- DynamoDB Local secondary indexes (LSI) are created at the same time that you create a table. You cannot add a local secondary index to an existing table, nor can you delete any local secondary indexes that currently exist.

8/17/25
- DynamoDB Global secondary indexes (GSI) does not support strong read consistency 
(ill try my best not to forget lmao)

- computer optimizer poggin

- The Amazon EC2 service provides virtual machines that emulate computer hardware, such as CPU, RAM and disk.
- The AWS service cannot see "inside" your instance because it is running an Operating System (Linux or Windows). It is the operating system that controls how memory is allocated, so it is not possible to determine "Memory Utilization" purely by looking at the virtual hardware.
- That's why the metrics provided are CPU Utilization, Network and Disk â€” they all involve the virtual hardware.

- finally reading on ECMP after putting off that shit for so long lmao

- EventBridge can listen to Trusted advisor checks' status changes, then you can trigger an event/target action based on rules defined by the dev.

- A black hole simply is a route that goes nowhere. (e.g. a route towards a since-then deleted network interface/instance)
- Blackhole routing can be an alternate means to mitigate DDoS attacks and block other malicious traffic. By discarding traffic intended for certain IP addresses, blackholing may improve network performance and reduce congestion.
- When dynamic routing is used with a VPN attachment or a Direct Connect gateway attachment, you can propagate the routes learned from the on-premises router through BGP to any of the transit gateway route tables.
- When dynamic routing is used with a VPN attachment, the routes in the route table associated with the VPN attachment are advertised to the customer gateway through BGP.
- You can peer two transit gateways, and route traffic between them.
- AWS Transit Gateway only shows a preferred route. example: Direct Connect gateway is preferred over Site-to-Site VPN (only serves as a backup route that will only display when DC gateway is no longer advertised). 
- Route table evaluation differs between whether you're using a VPC route table or a transit gateway route table.
- In a VPC route table, the VPC local route has the highest priority, followed by the routes that are the most specific. When a static route and a propagated route have the same destination, the static route has a higher priority.
- A network function attachment is a resource that connects a network security function (e.g. an AWS Network Firewall attachment) directly to your transit gateway. 
- AWS Network Firewall integration allows you to connect a firewall in the form of a group of Gateway Load Balancer Endpoints, one per Availability Zone, in a service-managed buffer VPC (created with appliance mode auto enabled). 

6/30/25
- having a route to the transit gateway isn't enough, you also need to ensure that a transit gateway attachment exists in the same AZ as the subnet sending the traffic, or the traffic will not be forwarded (it just gets dropped).

- it is weird that an AWS Control Tower account fails its prerequisites for some reason, and then making a single EC2 instance fixes this issue. I mean, it happened to me and I saw a vid on it
- really weird phenomena
- made me read further on Prerequisite: Automated pre-launch checks for your management account

- imagine not just using chocolatey to upgrade terraform version
- imagine going to the website to bother downloading the binary files
- lmao

- oh cloudwatch subscription filter doesnt directly accept a kinesis firehose delivery stream as a destination, only a kinesis stream ok
